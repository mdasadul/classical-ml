# Machine Learning Algorithms

Implementing classic machine learning algorithms using basic Python libraries, on datasets available publicly on the web. Although this repository focuses on implementation, I am planning to collect my own data and apply these algorithms on them for interesting tasks soon.

__NOTE__: It is recommended to view the iPython Notebook files (.ipynb) on https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/ instead of Github.

### Univariate Linear Regression
Using dataset from https://medium.com/we-are-orb/linear-regression-in-python-without-scikit-learn-50aef4b8d122.

### K-Nearest Neighbors
Using the classic Iris dataset from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Iris.
It is hard to visualize the actual datapoints, so here is the pairplot.
